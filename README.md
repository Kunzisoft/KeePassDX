## What is KeePassDX?

An alternative to remembering an endless list of passwords manually. This is made more difficult by **using different passwords for each account**. If you use one password everywhere and security fails only one of those places, it grants access to your e-mail account, website, etc, and you may not know about it or notice, before bad things happen.

KeePassDX is a **password manager for Android**, which helps you **manage your passwords in a secure way**. You can put all your passwords in one database, locked with a **master key** and/or a **keyfile**. You **only have to remember one single master password and/or select the keyfile** to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and **most secure encryption algorithms** currently known.

## Small print?

KeePassDX is under **open source GPL3 license**, meaning you can use, study, change and share it at will. Copyleft ensures it stays that way.
From the full source, anyone can build, fork, and check whether for example the encryption algorithms are implemented correctly.
There is **no advertising**.

Do not worry, **the main features remain completely free**.
