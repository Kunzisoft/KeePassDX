## What is KeePassDX?

An alternative to remembering an endless list of passwords manually. This is made more difficult by **using different passwords for each account**. If you use one password everywhere and security fails only one of those places, it grants access to your e-mail account, website, etc, and you may not know about it or notice, before bad things happen.

KeePassDX is a **password manager for Android**, which helps you **manage your passwords in a secure way**. You can put all your passwords in one database, locked with a **master key** or a **keyfile**. You **only have to remember one single master password or select the keyfile** to unlock the whole database. You control your security between different places to log in this way. The databases are encrypted using the best and **most secure encryption algorithms** currently known.

## Small print?

KeePassDX has **libre license**, meaning you can use, study, change and share it at will. Copyleft ensures it stays that way. There is no **without advertising**. From the full source, anyone can build, fork, and check whether for example the encryption algorithms are implemented correctly.
