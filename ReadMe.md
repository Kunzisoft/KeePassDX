## What is KeePass DX?

Today you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for your e-mail account, your website's FTP password, online passwords (like website member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is endless. Also, you **should use different passwords for each account**. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password you have a problem... A serious problem. The thief would have access to your e-mail account, website, etc. Unimaginable.

KeePass DX is a **free open source password manager for Android**, which helps you to **manage your passwords in a secure way**. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one **master key** or a **key file**. So you **only have to remember one single master password or select the key file** to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and **most secure encryption algorithms** currently known.

## Is it really free?

Yes, KeePass DX is under **free license (OSI certified)** and **without advertising**. You can have a look at its full source and check whether the encryption algorithms are implemented correctly.
